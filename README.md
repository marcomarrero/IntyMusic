Intellivision IntyBasic music playback display

http://atariage.com/forums/topic/255530-intymusic-music-viewer/

I present IntyMusic, a "music visualizer" for IntyBasic. It shows piano notes and a keyboard, updated from the current song playing. It should work with anyone's music, and I am including the source code, feel free to use it. 

I hope I didn't get anything wrong (I can't read or play music). There are timing bugs displaying notes - the way I am getting info from IntyBasic is a hack. 

The demo song is from The Music Studio software, a .SNG, converted to .MID, then copy/pasted from OPenMPT to Notepad++  then Intybasic. During playback, Clear will reset the program.

Enjoy!
